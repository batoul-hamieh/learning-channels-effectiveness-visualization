# Visual Insights of Learning Resource Effectiveness

## Overview
This project explores how Data Science students in Lebanon use online learning platforms alongside traditional university courses. It analyzes perceived learning effectiveness, skill development, and platform dependency using survey data and interactive visualizations.

The project is descriptive and visualization-driven, focusing on data storytelling rather than statistical modeling.

## Objectives
- Compare university-based learning with online platform learning
- Identify courses most frequently supplemented through online platforms
- Analyze motivations of platform users versus non-users
- Visualize perceived understanding and confidence levels

## Methodology
- Data collected through a bilingual (Arabic/English) online survey
- Target group: Lebanese Data Science students
- Data cleaning and preparation using Python (pandas)
- Exploratory, descriptive analysis
- Visualizations created using Flourish Studio

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas)
- Flourish Studio
- Google Forms
- CSV datasets

## Key Insights
- Most students rely on online platforms in addition to university courses
- Programming and computer science subjects are most commonly studied online
- Platform learning is perceived as more practical and mastery-oriented
- High-accessibility platforms (YouTube, W3Schools) dominate student usage
